What is 802.11w, and how does it enhance security in Wi-Fi networks?	802.11w is a protocol that provides protection for management frames in Wi-Fi networks. It ensures cryptographic protection for de-authentication and dissociation frames, preventing them from being spoofed in a Denial-of-Service (DOS) attack.
Which management frames are considered robust and protected by 802.11w?	The robust management frames protected by 802.11w include Spectrum Management, QoS, DLS, Block Ack, Radio Measurement, Fast BSS Transition, SA Query, Protected Dual of Public Action, and Vendor-specific Protected frames.
What is the purpose of the IGTK Key in 802.11w?	The IGTK (Integrity Group Temporal Key) is a randomly assigned value used to protect broadcast and multicast robust management frames in the Wi-Fi network. It ensures data integrity and replay protection for these frames.
How does Management Frame Protection work in 802.11w?	When Management Frame Protection is negotiated, the Access Point (AP) encrypts the GTK (Group Temporal Key) and IGTK values in the EAPOL-Key frame during the 4-way handshake. This process secures the communication between the AP and the clients.
How does 802.11w protect clients and the infrastructure in Wi-Fi networks?	802.11w protects clients by adding cryptographic protection for de-authentication and dissociation frames, preventing spoofing in DOS attacks. It also secures the infrastructure through a Security Association (SA) teardown protection mechanism, consisting of an Association Comeback Time and an SA-Query procedure to prevent spoofed association requests from disconnecting connected clients.
What is the purpose of the Broadcast/Multicast Integrity Protocol (BIP) in 802.11w?	The Broadcast/Multicast Integrity Protocol (BIP) in 802.11w provides data integrity and replay protection for broadcast and multicast robust management frames. It achieves this by adding a Message Integrity Code (MIC) calculated using the shared IGTK key after successful establishment of an IGTKSA.
How does 802.11w handle changes in the Group Temporal Key (GTK)?	If the AP changes the GTK, it sends the new GTK and IGTK values to the client using the Group Key Handshake. This ensures that clients receive the updated cryptographic protection for communication.
Which frames are not protected by 802.11w's Management Frame Protection?	Data traffic frames can be encrypted to provide confidentiality, but management frames such as authentication, association, beacons, and probes must be transmitted as open and unencrypted to be heard and understood by all clients.
How does 802.11w mitigate the risk of rogue devices spoofing management frames?	By using cryptographic protection and random IGTK keys, 802.11w prevents rogue devices from successfully spoofing management frames, thus enhancing the overall security of the wireless medium.
What is the role of the Authenticator STA (WLC) in the 802.11w protocol?	The Authenticator STA (Wireless LAN Controller - WLC) assigns random IGTK values and transmits them to the AP, enabling the protection of MAC management protocol data units (MMPDUs) from that AP.
